# Weather and Yield Dataset

This data set contains information on the weather: 

* date, 
* maximum temperature, 
* minimum temperature, 
* average temperature, and 
* total precipitation 

and 

* annual crop yield 

for municipalities in Manitoba, Canada.

The crop yield data are represented with a detailed farm-level panel data set of yield per acre and total acres for each crop type produced. The dataset includes 75 crop types from 19,238 farms and is available from Manitoba Agriculture (https://www.gov.mb.ca/agriculture/).

Historical weather data are obtained from the Environment Canada archive of the Adjusted and Homogenized Canadian Climate Data (AHCCD) for Manitoba (https://www.climate.weather.gc.ca/historical-data/).

The climate reanalysis data are obtained from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) (https://www.ecmwf.int/en/research/climate-reanalysis/era-interim/). We use the publicly available ERA-Interim dataset with a 12-hour interval of the weather records (the same variables as collected from the weather stations), the ERA-Interim data are recorded on a spatial grid (latitude and longitude).
