# Weather and Yield Dataset

This data set contains information on weather including Date, Maximum Temperature, Minimum Temperature, Average of Temperature and total Precipitation and crop yield for Municipalities in Manitoba, Canada.


The crop yield data are represented with a detailed farm-level panel data set of yield per acre and total acres for each crop type produced. The data set includes 75 crop types from 19,238 farms and is available from Manitoba Agriculture (https://www.gov.mb.ca/agriculture/).

Historical weather data are obtained from the Environment Canada archive of the Adjusted and Homogenized Canadian Climate Data (AHCCD) for Manitoba (https://www.climate.weather.gc.ca/historical-data/). For some Municipalities with missing data, we used the closest municipality to 

climate reanalysis data obtained from the European Centre for Medium- Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)(https://www.ecmwf.int/en
/research/climate-reanalysis/era-interim/). We use the publicly available ERA-Interim data set with 12-hour interval of the weather records (the same parameters as collected from the weather station, ERA-Interim data are recorded on a spatial grid (latitude and longitude).
